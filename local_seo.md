<p><strong><em>Local listing, Okay what is this?</em></strong> - This the ability for your business to appare when a customer searches for a product or service you offer.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do we do that? </em></strong> - With our <strong>Listing Distribution Service</strong> we submit business to all four major data providers: Factual, Acxiom, Infogroup and Neustar (Localeze). These data providers are referenced by over 300 online listing directories and disseminate business info all over the web.</p>

<p><strong>Why Do I Need This?</strong>

<p>Consider Kaffeinated Kodemonkey’s data analysis of 100,000 business locations: the average business has 68 online listings, and 41% of those listings have an inaccurate address. Furthermore, these businesses have an average of three different phone numbers across all of their listings. 73% of people lose trust in a brand when their listings are incorrect.<p>

<p>It’s essential that your business listings are right, or you could be driving them straight to your competitors. Customers blame businesses when their info is wrong, and they punish them for it.</p>
