    <p>That's right the word on the street is that I am FastTracking government websites to the portal.</p>

    <p><strong>What does that mean?</strong> That means if you are a Colorado-based government entity you don't have to wait in line.</p>

    <p><strong>SIPA</strong> - State Internet Portal Authority and Kaffeinated Kodemonkey have an agreement that allows our clients to jump to the front of the line.
    This allows for your site to be completed in half the time is would take if you do this yourself.</p>

    <p>At this time the FastTrack package is only available for Colorado governmental entities. The owner is looking for more companies like SIPA that the company can partner with and when we do we will be adding them to the site. If you are outside of Colorado don't fret our developers can work with you on a custom build.</p>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Starting at $4020</p>

    <p>Book a cup of coffee and we can discuss your needs and what will fit you budget.</p>
