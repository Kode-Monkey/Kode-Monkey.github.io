<h2>{{page.title}}</h2>

<p>Everyone can recall a time when they’ve received excellent customer service. Whether it was the clerk who was extra helpful or the hotel staff who went above and beyond, we’ve all experienced it. Unfortunately though, the bad customer service is almost always recalled more easily.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of excellent customer service, several dos and don’ts should be followed:</p>

<h3>Do: Anticipate Their Needs and Wants</h3>

<p>Instead of merely listening to your customer’s needs, a business needs to understand their unexpressed wishes and anticipate their next move. Staying one step ahead of them—literally giving them what they didn’t know they needed—is how you will stand out from the rest. This builds exceptional rapport with your customer and makes them feel like you really, truly value their business (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/05/28/stop-listening-and-start-anticipating-your-customers-needs/#3b85f5bb6b4f" target="blank" title="Stop 'Listening' And Start Anticipating Your Customers' Needs">Forbes</a>). They will want to come back, and what’s more, they’re going to tell their friends all about your customer service.</p>

<h3>Do: Show Genuine Interest</h3>

<p>If you haven’t heard it yet, here it is: customers want to feel appreciated and they value an honest-to-goodness relationship. If your customer service staff can build, nourish and manage relationships with your customers, then you’re golden! One way for you to build the relationship and make them feel special is by genuinely caring about what they’re telling you. Listen to them grumble, show sympathy, laugh when they laugh and don’t be afraid to get personal (<a href="https://www.inc.com/rhett-power/10-simple-ways-to-show-your-customers-you-care.html" target="blank" title="10 Simple Ways to Show Your Customers You Care">Inc.com</a>). Something as minute as memorizing the name of their granddaughter or asking about their last trip to Hawaii will help solidify your relationship.</p>

<p>Digitally speaking, doing this well means using social media to engage in a conversation and being open and transparent online! Your online customer service is as important, if not more so than the face-to-face interactions. At the root of it all, the customer wants to feel that they’re spending their hard-earned dollar on a business that cares about them!</p>

<h3>Do: Have the Answers and Deliver</h3>

<p>While it’s up for debate on whether customers are always right, the fact of the matter is, you are the expert and not your customer. You should always have the answers and be able to deliver. That is why product and service knowledge is the most vital skill a customer service representative can possess (<a href="https://www.digitalistmag.com/lob/sales-marketing/2014/04/30/the-importance-of-product-knowledge-01249743" target="blank" title="The Importance Of Product Knowledge">Digitalist</a>).</p>

<p>If you don’t have the answer, try your best to find it out or direct the customer to someone who can answer their queries. Avoid saying the phrase, “I don’t know” at all costs. Remember, you’re the expert. Having the answers and delivering them promptly and respectively will build trust and confidence in your customer.</p>

<h3>Don’t: Restrict the Customer</h3>

<p>Customers hate to hear the word, “no.” It’s a fact of life. Though it’s not always possible to say “yes,” best practice dictates that you should be as flexible and accommodating as possible for your customers (<a href="http://www.customerservicemanager.com/what-customers-really-want-six-secrets-of-customer-service/" target="blank" title="What Customers Really Want ">Customer Service Manager</a>).</p>

<p>If there’s one thing a customer hates to hear more than “no,” it’s that something is “company policy.” Why? First of all, the customer likely doesn’t care what your store policy is. Second, they don’t see you as a customer service provider following policy, but rather as the company as an entity restricting them from getting what they want. Another reason this is such a big no-no is that it’s like putting a big road block in the conversation. With both you and the customer at a loss for what to say, the interaction (and possibly the relationship) is subsequently squelched.</p>

<h3>Don’t: Make Things Overly Complicated</h3>

<p>A good rule of thumb to follow is that getting assistance and service should not be more painful than the problem itself. Behold! The wonders of a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page! If this isn’t really your style, and as a necessary fall back, the next step is to make your customer service staff incredibly accessible. You know what they say: a quickly diffused customer service issue keeps the bad reviews away. Right?</p>

<p>Speaking of which…</p>

<h3>Don’t: Ignore Feedback or Complaints</h3>

<p>Feedback, no matter its form, is always a plus. Who better to hear from than the customers who are literally the lifeblood of your business?<?p>

<p>Embracing the good, the bad and the ego-deflating will ultimately help you to strive for better in the long run, we promise. You’ll be able to understand your customer better, identify and solve your pitfalls and grow bigger and better (<a href="http://minutehack.com/opinions/how-feedback-can-build-a-business" target="blank"> title="How Feedback Can Build A Business">MinuteHack</a>)! So, the next time a customer wants to give you their feedback, don’t brush it off, but rather see it as an opportunity to improve.</p>

<p>Good customer service always will be an essential part of a business. It’s your customer’s first point of contact with your business and allows them to connect and build trust with your business or brand. In today’s world, delivering excellent customer service is sometimes more effective than any advertisement could be!</p>

<p>Follow these customer service dos and don’ts so people talk about you for all the right reasons.</p>
