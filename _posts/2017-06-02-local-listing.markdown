<h2 class="section-heading">What is Local Listings?</h2>

<p>Ah yes, I have been asked this question time and time again.
Most over I have a friend that struggles to understand the difference between indexing and listings.
Who can blame her.</p>

<p>When we are talking about local listings, this refers to two processes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Index Listings </li>
<li>Directories Listings</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal here is to help the local business owner, or the manager of a governmental entity know the difference between the two and why each is
uniquely valuable.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">First up is Search Engine Indexing:</h2>

<p>The search engines use little programs called spiders or bots that scour the Internet, follow links, and bring back information to the search
engine’s index or database about your website. When you Google you’re not searching the Web, you’re searching Google’s index or copy of the Web.</p>

<p>Having your site indexed by the search engines is a must do. This is how your customers/clients will find your business and all it's glory when
they do their next search. If you are not listed in the indexes, then your next appointment can not contact you, or your next order will go to your
competition.</p>

<p>So how do you get your site indexed?</p>
<p>Well, gone are the day of <a href="http://seosherpa.com/search-engine-submission/" target="_blank" title="Search Engine Submission"><strong>submitting the URL</strong></a>
to the search engines. As of the early 2000's most search engine no longer accept URL submissions. Nowadays they rely heavily on the spiders to crawl the web and find your site. Sound great just let those spiders do their thing. Well not exactly
you or your developer still need to be on top, more so now than before, of your SEO. With 300+ search engine crawling the web every day you want to
make sure you are putting your best for forward and showing up in the right locations, categories, and searches that pertain to your business.</p>

<p>Here at Kaffeinated Kodemonkey, we offer <a href="http://www.kaffeinatedkodemonkey.com/ListingDistribution" title="Listing Distribution"><strong>Listing Distribution</strong></a> to help give you a boost. With Listing Distribution your business information (name, phone, address, website, etc.) is submitted to the top four data providers that feed your data to the 300+ search engines. The search engines work reference the data providers for updated information about the sites they crawl and mark this information as most accurate. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Directory Listings:</h2>

<p>I am sure you have seen them or even use them and just don't realize it. Directory Listings are the business directories that "You Manage." Yep, Google Business or Yahoo & Bing listings.</p>

<p>This is like taking out a business add in the local yellow pages however now it is all online. YP - Yellow Pages - Yeap online. There are 70+ of this nifty Local Listings you can take advantage of, and it will help you rank higher. </p>

<p><strong>Why is this so important?</strong> If you are not claiming your listing most likely some third party will be and that is not good for business. Also, search engines will rank you higher the more listings you have. To them, listings prove validity and trust, this shows you mean business, and we all know you do.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get listed you ask?</strong> Well, that is just it. You have to set aside some time and get ready to dive deep into the web. You will have to do some head bashing and hair pulling searching if you want to find the "Free" business submission link. Took me two hours just to find yahoos and not to mention Bing that is another story, made me so mad. Oh and if you are not careful, you will find yourself filling out all the account info and listing stuff just to be asked for a Credit Card. Now you are welcome to pay $50 to $100 + for each listing, but that can get pricey.</p>
