    <p>Excellent service! My website was neglected due to more urgent business needs. Heather restored it to a highly functional and visible business asset. I will always lean on her for any additional electronic marketing needs.</p>

      <p>Heather, owner of Kaffeinated Kodemonkey, completed the Rio Blanco Water Conservancy District website on a shoe string budget. She was highly accommodating working with us to obtain our preferred needs in a timely and efficient manner. We will continue with the webpage development/improvements into 2018 which includes increased web exposure and continued website maintenance.</p>

    <p>The CISC engaged Heather Welsh (KKM) to build a new CISC website. The results have been outstanding. Heather is incredibly competent in technical site design and the subtle nuances of the Internet.
       Interpersonally, she is also a wonderful communicator. Her open, positive, fun to talk to, forward-thinking, energetic personality and style make all involved effort a pleasure.
       Certainly the site is not yet complete, but if what I see today is any indication, the CISC Board and Member Agencies will be delighted with the final result.</p>
