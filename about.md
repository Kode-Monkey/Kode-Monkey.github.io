    <h2>Who is Kaffeinated Kodemonkey?</h2>

    <h3>Heather Welsh ~ Owner, Developer, & Accessibility Expert</h3>

    <p>A rural development company based in the Uintah Basin with a passion for Web Development and Accessibility.</p>

    <p>I develop websites for rural business and local government entities specializing in Web Accessibility. I make sure all
    sites meet the standards for ADA & 508 compliance.</p>

    <h2>Company History</h2>

    <p>I have been writing code and building website for over 10 years. I began learning code 1995, earned my associate's degree in software engineering in the early 2000's, and received my certification in Ruby on Rails in 2012. In Sept 2017 I took a course in Web Accessibility to understand how to build websites that meet the WCAG standards.</p>

    <p>My experience comes from working with startup companies, large corporations, colleges, GoCode & hackathons, and doing freelance work. Over the years I found myself drawn to helping the small companies succeed online.</p>

    <p>Over four (4) years ago I moved from Denver to Rangely in search of a small community I could base my company out. I felt there was no better way to reach the rural communities than to live among them. That soon became more apparent than I first thought. I work with clients from Rangely to De Beque and I am looking to expand into the Uintah Basin.</p>

     <p>Regardless of the context of my job, my top priority is producing outstanding sites and happy clients. My goal is to make sure your clients/customers can find you and that you are represented online at your best.</p>

    <h2>What do I do?</h2>
    <p>I educate business owners on the importance of a winning, customer engaging web presence. What ADA compliance is and why  you should be including it your design.</p>

    <p>I also help business owners understand how they stack up against competitors online and how to handle Social Media.</p>

    <p>I understand the pain points of small business owners as-well-as the process involved for Government entities with boards and associations.</p>

    <h2>Where am I going?</h2>
    <p>I am building a platform that allows jr developer the opportunity to gain valuable skills and experience to obtain the career they want.</p>

    <p>My vision is to bring CoderDojo to the western slopes and give kids the opportunity to learn, grow, and build the strengths they need for the future.</p>

    <p>My vision may be grand however I believe this is something our community needs and I am willing to work hard to see it happen.</p>
