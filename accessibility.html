    <h2>Web Accessibile is not an Option</h2>

    <blockquote class="bg-info">You may be thinking, "Who Governs Web Accessibility?" and "What does it matter to my business?", "I will worry about when the time comes".</blockquote>

    <p>For the moment it is not a requirement, nor is it mandated, however, the DOJ is working to change this by 2018. You are risking lawsuits and a variety of legal
    complications if you are not meeting accessibility standards.</p>

    <blockquote class="bg-success">In 2016, over 240 lawsuits, were filed against companies for their websites not being accessible to the blind and visually impaired.</blockquote>

    <p>Aside from ADA compliance other reasons to make sure your website is accessible is:</p>

      <li>Improve search engine optimization (SEO)</li>
      <li>Make future maintenance and updates easier</li>
      <li>Create wider device support </li>
    </ul>
