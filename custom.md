title: Custom Build
---

<p>Custom builds are for those that are looking for more functionality than our Rural package offers or more than a web builder platform can offer.</p>

<p>We take pride in developing a site that is both easy for you to update and stunning for your customers.</p>

<p>Our custom builds are developed on an open source content management platform built using the Django Framework. What does this mean to you? That you can rest assure that your site will be powerful, consistent, and flexible for anything that comes its way.</p>

<p>Our platform is able to provide a simple yet highly extensible architecture that allows your developer the freedom to design what you need. This approach yields a more integrated and efficient platform.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Call for a quote or Book a Cup of Coffee and we can discuss your need.
