<p>Custom builds are for those that are looking for more functionality than our Rural package offers or more than a web builder platform can offer.</p>

<p>We take pride in developing a site that is both easy for you to update and stunning for your customers.</p>

<p>Our custom builds are developed on an open source content management platform built using the Django Framwork. What dose this mean to you?
This way you can rest assure that your site will be powerful, consistent, and flexible for anything that comes its way. Our platform is able to provided a simple yet highly extensible architecture that allows your developer the freedom to design what you need.</p>

<p>Your site will function in away much like the well known CMS platform Wordpress, providing an intuitive interface for managing pages, blog posts, form data, store products, and other types of content, and yet be so different from other site. Unlike many other platforms that make extensive use of modules or reusable applications, our platform provides most of the functionality is built in by default. This approach yields a more integrated and efficient platform.</p>
